                <h2>first day to learn code</h2>

                <p class="paragraph">Published on September 14, 2025 by Sarah</p>

                <p>Today was so exciting! I started learning HTML, CSS, and now JavaScript with my parent. HTML is like the skeleton of a website, and CSS is like the clothes. JavaScript is like the brain that makes it do things! We built this very blog design together. It was challenging but super fun to see my code come to life on the screen! I can't wait to learn what's next.</p>
